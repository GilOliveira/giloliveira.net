I'm a Biologist currently based in Lisbon, Portugal working as a research fellow at the NOVA School of Science & Technology in the Systems Biology and Engineering Group. I'm researching hybrid modelling of human cell factories as part of a multidisciplinary team in collaboration with a biopharma company in order to develop a novel, AI-based solution to improve vaccine production.
