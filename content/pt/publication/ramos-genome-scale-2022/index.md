abstract: Flux balance analysis is currently the standard method to compute metabolic
  fluxes in genome-scale networks. Several variations employing diverse objective
  functions and/or constraints have been published. Here we propose a hybrid semi-parametric
  version of flux balance analysis that combines mechanistic-level constraints (parametric)
  with empirical constraints (non-parametric), at the genome-scale. A CHO dataset
  with 27 measured exchange fluxes obtained from 21 reactor experiments served to
  evaluate the method. The reduced CHO genome-scale model comprehended 686 metabolites,
  788 reactions and 210 degrees of freedom. The experimental flux dataset could be
  compressed to 6 principal components retaining 93.7% of explained variance. The
  conjugation of both types of constraints is coded as a linear program with comparable
  computational cost as standard flux balance analysis. The hybrid flux balance analysis
  showed a significant reduction in the specific growth rate prediction error in comparison
  to the non-hybrid version. The hybrid method was eventually used to design a metabolically
  efficient feed to extend cell expansion from 9.87 Mcell/ml to 22.48 Mcell/ml at
  the point of induction with minimal accumulation of byproducts. It is concluded
  that the predictive advantage of the hybrid method resulted from the statistical
  abstraction of regulatory mechanisms, which were absent in the standard flux balance
  analysis.
