## What is this?

This is the source code for my personal website. It is not the actual HTML/CSS that is running on the server, but rather the code that is used to generate the static pages using a static page generator.

## What technologies/services are you using?

- [**Markdown**](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (.md files) for the website content.
- [**Wowchemy**](https://wowchemy.com) for the theme (Academic) and the website builder system.
- [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) for the static page generation.

## How do you build the website?

The workflow of my website basically goes like this:

1. I edit the website content which is written in Markdown;
2. Commit the changes to this GitHub repo;
3. The commit triggers the Hugo website building script on Netlify;
4. The generated static website is deployed to the Netlify CDN.

## Are you paying anything for this?

Basically nothing... most of the software I am using is open-source and the services I use are all on their free tiers. The only thing I am actually paying for are the domain names.

## Am I being tracked when browsing your website?

Not by me. I have disabled analytics and don't actively track visitors.
